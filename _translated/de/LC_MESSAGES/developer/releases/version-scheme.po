"The Qubes OS Project uses the `semantic versioning <https://semver.org/>`__ "
"standard. Version numbers are written as ``<major>.<minor>.<patch>``. When "
"``<patch>`` is omitted (e.g., ``4.1``), it is usually either because "
"``<patch>`` is zero (as in ``4.1.0``) or because we are referring to a "
"specific minor release irrespective of any particular patch release within "
"it. Similarly, the major release number alone (e.g., ``R4``) is sometimes "
"used to refer to an entire release series inclusive of all minor and patch "
"releases within it."

"In general, patch releases are for backward-compatible bug fixes, minor "
"releases are for backward-compatible enhancements and new features, and "
"major release are for any backward-incompatible changes. This means that, in"
" general, one should *not* try to introduce features or enhancements in "
"patch releases or any backward-incompatible changes in patch or minor "
"releases. (Templates are a notable exception, as upstream OSes almost always"
" have their own release schedules.) Bug fixes are allowed in all releases, "
"and backward-compatible changes are allowed in all major and minor releases."

"Following standard practice, **version** refers to any build that has been "
"assigned a version name or number, e.g., ``3.2-rc2``, ``4.0.4``, "
"``4.1-beta1``. By contrast, **release** refers to any version that is "
"intended for consumption by the general userbase. For example, ``4.0.4`` was"
" both a **version** and a **release**, since it was stable and intended for "
"general public use, while ``4.1-beta1`` was a **version** but *not* a "
"**release**, since it was not stable and was intended only for :doc:`testing"

"versions, but not all versions are releases."
